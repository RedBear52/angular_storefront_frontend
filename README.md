# My Angular Storefront Project

This is the penultimate project in Udacity's Full Stack Javascript Developer nanodegree course. The developer is asked to provide a clean and logically organized storefront web application with common e-commerce functionality (adding products to a cart, checking out, etc.).

The requisite functionality is made possible through the leveraging of the Angular framework's many built-in features, including routing, module management, components, services, dialogues and http client modules.

In this particular project, I've used a JSON file to store the product data.

This is not a good practice for a production application, but building a store's backend was not the focus of this endeavor.

With a relatively minimal amount of effort, the JSON file could be replaced with a pre-existing database.

The styling of the application is also quite minimal as it is not the primary focus of the project.

Additionally, the Angular Material library was used to provide a consistent layout and visual signature.

## Web Technologies Used

-   Angular Material
-   Node.js
-   HTTP
-   Prettier
-   Typescript
-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JSON
-   Git

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js
-   Angular CLI

## How to Run the Application Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/RedBear52/myStoreProject.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd myStoreProject`
3. Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies
4. Run `ng serve` to start the application
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser on the default port.

    If you prefer a different port than 4200, you can specify as much through the CLI command: `ng serve --port <preferred port numbere>`.
